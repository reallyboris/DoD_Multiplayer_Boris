# DoD-Multiplayer


DoD-Multiplayer port maintained by Zombie_Freak115, ported from the HPM-version of DoD. Keep in mind that early versions do not have a changelog.

If you have problems with your screen resolution in newer versions, change the resolution in the game options menu. If you are unable to do so, go to the settings file in documents to change your resolution manually, or change "fullScreen=no" to "fullScreen=yes" in the same settings file.

Credits to Shark for helping the project in the first versions, credits to the original DoD-creator, and credits to Pergame95 for porting DoD to HPM.
